## Chartery

Chartery is a simple library for making interactive and scalable charts using simple javascript and css to create SVG objects.

## Code Example

Here are a few fiddles to make it quick and easy to see and play with the various charts:

* Line Chart: <http://jsfiddle.net/3fhtezzy/>

* Single Skew Chart: <http://jsfiddle.net/x6o8oc4j/2/>

* Comparison Skew Chart: <http://jsfiddle.net/hnec3ng5/1/>

* Bar Graph (with a goal value): <http://jsfiddle.net/3ptd9cy1/1/>

* Donut: <http://jsfiddle.net/9r1cd7cs/2/>

* Donut Meter: <http://jsfiddle.net/9r1cd7cs/2/>

## Background

After trying many charting libraries (and never finding exactly what I wanted) I decided to make my own. The goal is an easily-customizable, scalable, and clean set of charts. Hopefully you find them useful and be sure to let me know what new type of chart/feature would be helpful.

## Installation

Just include the .js and .css (or their minified versions) files in your project and go to town!
